## Install
We used python 3.8 to run this code. To install all requirements via pip:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset:
We use Tiny-Imagenet-200 dataset to test our code starting from  small with subsets of 10 classes, then eventually expand to larger and larger subsets, making my way up to all 200 classes. To download this datset follow thes steps:

```bash
$ wget http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip
$ unzip tiny-imagenet-200.zip
```

## Train the model
To train the model, you can run: 

## Parrllel
